# typescript-eslint-issue-1

### General Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `v22.6.0` installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
- Modern Yarn requires [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to be enabled. To enable corepack, it is sufficient to run `corepack enable` once (requires Node.js).
  You might need to enable corepack again every time you update Node.js (especially if you use NVM).
- We use [GIT LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to store large binary files. Make sure you have it installed and configured. You might need to run `git lfs install` once.

### The Issue

See `./src/index.ts` and `./src/modules.d.ts`.
